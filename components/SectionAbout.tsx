        <p>{`Iâ€™ve been crafting human-centered software, mobile apps and web experiences for over a decade. I am dedicated to simplifying complexity and designing intuitive systems. Even though I consider myself a designer, I have found code to be the best tool for translating my ideas into reality. I excel on bridging the gap between design and development, ensuring the creation of delightful and ethical solutions to provide value to both users and businesses.

I have designed user interfaces and experiences, mapped out and implemented roadmaps and features, led cross-functional teams, mentored other designers, and fostered the growth of design teams. All within agency and internal corporate environments.

I am currently seeking new opportunities, so if you believe we would be a good fit, please reach out!`}</p>
