    <p className="text-moderate leading-8 h-padding">
      Family man, wanne-be gravel-biker, part-time developer, and passionate
      designer. Designing systems and reducing complexity to make it manageable,
      that fascinates me. In the past, this meant designing typography and grid
      systems for catalogs and magazines. Today, it involves developing digital
      products with extensive design systems and the teams and processes to
      build them. I love to bridge the gap between design and development to
      ensure that we truly build delightful human-centered solutions.
